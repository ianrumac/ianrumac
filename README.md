## Hi , I'm Ian! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer & architect specialised in Kotlin and Mobile, but I often tend to stray into the world of backend development, JavaScript, Rust and all kinds of fun stuff.

I'm currently working on multiple things for fun - [Redukks](https://github.com/ianrumac/redukks), [Bookie](https://github.com/ianrumac/bookie-js),
[DevRel Studio](https://github.com/Devrel-Studio/) - and some more hidden gems on the way!

If you want to know more about me, you can always visit [my website](https://ianrumac.com), my [blog](https://blog.entropy.observer) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@IanIsSoAwesome) or check out [my twitter](https://twitter.com/ianissoawesome) for up-to-date spam.
